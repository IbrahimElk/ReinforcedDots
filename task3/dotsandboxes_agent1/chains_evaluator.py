Chains are sequences of one or more capturable boxes ("corridors").

2 kinds of chains exist:
    1. half-open chains: only one end of chain is capturable. (= corridor with 3 edges filled in)
    2. closed chains: both ends of chain are capturable.      (= corridor with 4 edges filled in)

Most moves on a state with chains are suboptimal, using this knowledge can reduce the branching 
factor of the game tree.

Half-open chains, only 2 moves are part of a optimal strategy:
    1.  Capture every available box in that chain and make an additional move.
    2.  Capture all but 2 boxes in that chain and fill in the end of the chain.
        This creates a hard-hearted handout.

Closed chains, only 2 moves is part of a optimal strategy:
    1.  Capture every available box in that chain and make an additional move.
    2.  Capture all but 4 boxes in that chain and fill in the edge that separates it in 
        2 hard-hearted handouts.

More than 1 chain available:
    1. Fill all but 1 available chains, and follow the above mentioned strategies for the remaining
        chain. If possible choose half-open chain as the last one. (Sacrifices only 2 instead of 4)

        

Stackoverflow:

The first is the double-cross strategy: The same double-cross strategy applies no 
matter how many long chains there are: a player using this strategy will take all 
but two boxes in each chain and take all the boxes in the last chain. If the chains 
are long enough, then this player will win. 

Second, the parity rule for long chains. This follows from three facts about the majority of well-played games:

    1.The long chains will be played out at the very end of the game.
    2.There will be a double cross in every chain except the last one.
    3.The player who first has to play in any long chain loses the game.

    
The third and most powerful observation is that dots and boxes is an impartial game: 
the available moves are the same regardless of whose turn it is to play, and in typical 
positions that arise in the course of play (that is, ones containing long chains of boxes) 
it's also a normal game: the last player to move wins. The combination of these properties 
means that positions can be analyzed statically using Spragueâ€“Grundy theory.
